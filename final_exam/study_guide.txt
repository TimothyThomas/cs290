HTML tags:  
==========
html - outer tags for doc
head - metadata 
link - link to CSS <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css" type="text/css"
body - content
script - javascript file
a - anchor, links to other pages <a href="http://foo.com">a link to foo</a>
ul - unordered list
li - list item
p - paragraph
section - used to group related content. Doesn't do much visually.
div - use when no other element makes sense. Doesn't do much visually.
span - groups inline-elements (provides no visual change by itself) 
h[1-4] - headers (block level) 
form - contains content and user inputs (can't contain other forms) 
    form attributes:
        action - specifies where form should be sent
        method - get or post
input - elements within a form where user enters data. must have type and name attributes. 
    type attribute: type of input
    name attribute: name part of the name=value sent to server for the input
table - open/close a table
tr - table row (contains either td or th)
th - header cell
td - data cell
thead - table header, contains rows that represent header
tbody - table body, contains rows with data 
Example:
    <table>
      <caption>Characteristics with positive and negative sides</caption>
      <thead>
       <tr>
        <th> Characteristic
        <th> Negative
        <th> Positive
      <tbody>
       <tr>
        <th> Mood
        <td> Sad
        <td> Happy
       <tr>
        <th> Grade
        <td> Failing
        <td> Passing
    </table>

Example HTML Skeleton
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>title</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css" type="text/css"
 </head>
 <body>
 </body>
</html>

CSS Properties:
===============
background-color - background color of an element 
border-style - 
border-color - border color of an element 
border-width
padding - space between edge of box and its content
margin - how far one box is from another
width - width:50% will make an element half as wide as its parent

CSS Selectors:
==============
Ex CSS rule:  (selector comes before {}, property-value pairs are inside {})

    a.homepage:link, a.homepage:visited{
        color: #fff;
        background: #444;
    }

ID selector:  targets the single element with matching ID
Class selector: targets all elements of a given class
Type selectors: select elements based on type and relationship to other elements:
    basic type:  specify an element name directly.  p will target all paragraph elements
    descendent selector:  targets all elements of type 'x' which are descendet of type y
                          Syntax: y x
                          So 'nav ul' will apply a style to all ul
                          elements whose direct parent is a nav element.
    child selector: targets all elements of type x which are direct children of type y.
                    Syntax: y>x
    adjacent sibling: target all of element type x  which is at same level on tree and
                      immediately after element of type y.
                      y+x
    general sibling: like adjacent sibling but does not need to immediately follow.
                     Syntax: y~x


Key Questions From Modules
==========================

Web Overview
------------
What is a client? What is a server?  Client asks for something.  Server serves it. 
Generally speaking, what is the life-cycle of a page?  
    When can client modify it?  In between requests.
    When can server modify it?  While processing a request 
    1. User clicks a link.
    2. Browser sends request.
    3. Server responds to request.
    4. Client receives response.
    5. Client redners the page.
Why do we need to have code both on client and sever?
How are structure, layout and logic separated?  Why would we want to do this?
What is HTTP?  What are the core pieces of an HTTP transaction? 
    HyperText Transfer Protocol.  2 parts:  request and response.
    Request has headers (always) and body (often blank).
    GET: query string is in URL.
    POST: query string is in the request body.
     
HTML and CSS
--------------
What is purpose of HTML?  Organize, describe and give meaning to data. Use tables
    only for tabular data, not to create complicated layouts.
What is purpose of CSS?  Define look of a page.
Where should classes and ids be used?  to help with CSS.

Javascript
-----------
What is dynamically typed? It does not check types statically; only when code is run.
What is an interpreted language? Not compiled, interpreted on the fly.
Where can JavaScript be run?  Node.js interpreter, browser (inside an html doc)
What are the primitive types in JS? number, string, boolean, undefined, null (object)
If something is not a primitive in JS, what is it?  object or function
Is the FUNCTION keyword needed to create a callable function? YES.  What is its significance?
    Functions are HOISTED to the top, so they can be called before being declared.
    UNLESS a function is assigned to a variable, then it is not hoisted and can't be
    called prior to being created.
How are functions defined in JS?  
    function callSquare(x) { 
        return x * x;
    }
    OR  
    var square = function(x) {
            return x * x;
    }
What is JSON? And what is its relationship to objects? Very similr but keys in JSON must
always have quotes.  Can't have function in JSON notation, but you can in JS objects.
What tools can we use to debug JS? JSFiddle, browser.

JS Functions and Objects
------------------------
When a function is returned from another function what variables does it have access to?
What are some use cases for passing functions other functions?
What are the differences for using the basis object notation vs an object constructor?
What is the prototype chain? When is it used?

Closure:  when a function is defined within another function a closure is generated.  It
stores all the contents of that parent function more permanently so they can still be
referenced by the functions defined within.
